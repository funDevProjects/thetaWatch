### What it Does
ThetaWatch integrates with the Theta Explorer api to pull node data into an off-chain database. This allows the application to run a number of custom reports that users can search and filter for their own purposes. 

By standardizing the common search/print/download/charting features, it also creates a hub where community members can request custom charts to be added for the whole community to utilize in their own investing, staking, or other research needs.
